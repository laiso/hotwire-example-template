# Hotwire Example Template

We'll cover:

1. `<input type="radio">` change hides/shows management phone number
2. `<select>` change hides/shows management phone number and explanation
3. `<select>` change to fetch contents within a `<turbo-frame>`

## Our starting point

Collect a Building's address, along with whether or not it's owned or leased.
When it's leased, the form also requires that the management phone number is
provided.
