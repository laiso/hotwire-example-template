# Hotwire: Server-rendered live previews

The upcoming [Rails 7][] release will be notable for numerous reasons.
One of the more remarkable being the deprecation and removal of Rails
UJS, and the introduction of [Hotwire][] as Rails' [default JavaScript
framework][].

Let's learn more about how Hotwire fits into Rails by building an
Article drafting experience that provides end-users with a preview of
their final version as they type!

We'll start with an out-of-the-box Rails installation that utilizes
Turbo Drive, Turbo Streams, and Stimulus to then progressively enhance
concepts and tools that are built directly into browsers. Plus, it'll
degrade gracefully when JavaScript is unavailable!

The code samples contained within omit the majority of the application's
setup. While reading, know that the bulk of the application's code was
generated by a `rails new` command

The rest of the source code from this article can be found [on
GitHub][].

## Drafting Articles

We'll start by using Rails `model` generator to create some `Article`
[scaffolding][] code to serve as a starting point for our extensions and
customizations:

```sh
bin/rails generate scaffold Article content:text
bin/rails db:migrate
```

We won't be making any changes to the vast majority of the generated code, but
there are two view partials that will be changed the most throughout the rest of
the article. To have context for those changes, it's worth becoming familiar
with them before we get started: `app/views/articles/_form.html.erb` and
`app/views/articles/_article.html.erb`.

The `articles/form` partial renders a single `<textarea>` field for our
`Article` model's `content`, along with an `<input type="submit">`
element:

```erb
<%= form_with(model: article) do |form| %>
  <% if article.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(article.errors.count, "error") %> prohibited this article from being saved:</h2>

      <ul>
        <% article.errors.each do |error| %>
          <li><%= error.full_message %></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <% end %>

  <div class="field">
    <%= form.label :content %>
    <%= form.text_area :content %>
  </div>

  <div class="actions">
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Similarly, the `articles/article` partial renders the value of the
`content` as plain text:

```erb
<div id="<%= dom_id article %>" class="scaffold_record">
  <p>
    <strong>Content:</strong>
    <%= article.content %>
  </p>

  <p>
    <%= link_to "Show this article", article %>
  </p>
</div>
```

The rest of the generated code serves as the foundation for creating,
reading, updating, and destroying `Article` instances. While it's
crucial, they're implementation details that we can ignore for the sake
of this example.

## Previewing our changes

<abbr title="Hyper-text transfer protocol">HTTP</abbr> request-response
exchanges and full <abbr title="Hyper-text markup language">HTML</abbr>
documents will serve as a stable foundation for the feature.

Let's implement it through `<form>` submissions that are handled by Rails'
router, controller, and view layers. The HTTP response will redirect
_back_ to the `Article` form, with the contents encoded into the URL as
a query parameter, and rendered as a preview of a published `Article`.

In this first version, the application doesn't make use of **any**
Hotwire concepts.

First, let's introduce a `:create` route that handles `POST` requests to
generate `Article` previews:

```diff
--- a/config/routes.rb
+++ b/config/routes.rb
 Rails.application.routes.draw do
   resources :articles
+  resources :previews, only: :create
   # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
 end
```

Next, we'll declare a `<button>` element within the `article/form`
partial's `<form>` element to submit to the new `POST /previews` route:

```diff
--- a/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
   <div class="actions">
     <%= form.submit %>
+    <%= form.button "Preview Article", formaction: previews_path %>
   </div>
 <% end %>
```

The `<button>` element affords an alternative means of submitting the
form by declaring a [formaction="/previews"][button-formaction]
attribute. Setting `[formaction="/previews"]` overrides _where_ the
`<form>` submits to when the `<button>` is clicked, enabling the
secondary `<button>` to supplement the primary submission `<button>`,
which continues to submit to the route specified by the `<form
action="/articles">` element's `[action]` attribute when clicked.

To ensure that clicking the `<button>` submits a `POST` request,
regardless of the `<form method="…">` attribute or a [Rails-generated
`<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="…">` element][_method],
invoke `form.method` with `name:` and `value:` options:

```diff
--- a/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
   <div class="actions">
     <%= form.submit %>
-    <%= form.button "Preview Article", formaction: previews_path %>
+    <%= form.button "Preview Article", formaction: previews_path,
+          name: "_method", value: "post" %>
   </div>
 <% end %>
```

The `PreviewsController` declared in
`app/controllers/previews_controller.rb` handles the `POST /previews`
request by constructing an instance of an `Article` from `params`
corresponding to the `<form>` element's submitted fields, then redirects
_back_ to the `GET /articles/new` route:

```ruby
class PreviewsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @preview = Article.new(article_params)

    redirect_to new_article_url(article: @preview.attributes)
  end

  private

  def article_params
    params.require(:article).permit(:content)
  end
end
```

When redirecting to the `GET /articles/new` route, we'll encode the
`content` value into URL query parameters by passing the `Hash` returned
by [Article#attributes][attributes] to the `new_article_url` under the
`article` scope.

It's worth noting that  according to the [HTTP specification][], there
are no limits on the length of a URI:

> The HTTP protocol does not place any a priori limit on the length of
> a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle the URI of any resource they
> serve, and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of unbounded length if they
> provide GET-based forms that could generate such URIs.
>
> - 3.2.1 General Syntax

In practice, [conventional wisdom][] suggests that URLs over 2,000
characters are risky.

[HTTP specification]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.2.1
[conventional wisdom]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184

To read those values and pass them along to the `Article` instance
constructed by the `articles#new` action, we'll need to make some tweaks
to the `ArticlesController#article_params` and `ArticlesController#new`
methods so that the `articles#new` action supports reading from query
parameters when they're present:

```diff
--- a/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
+++ b/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb
@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@ class ArticlesController < ApplicationController

   # GET /articles/new
   def new
-    @article = Article.new
+    @article = Article.new(article_params)
   end

   # GET /articles/1/edit
@@ -53,6 +53,6 @@ class ArticlesController < ApplicationController

     # Only allow a list of trusted parameters through.
     def article_params
-      params.require(:article).permit(:content)
+      params.fetch(:article, {}).permit(:content)
     end
 end
```

The `Article` record assigned to the `@article` instance variable is
eventually passed to the `articles/form` partial and made available
through the `article` partial-local variable. Within the `articles/form`
partial, render the `articles/article` partial using the pre-populated
`article` reference:

```diff
--- a/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/articles/_form.html.erb
   </div>

+  <div class="field">
+    <strong>Preview:</strong>
+    <div id="article_preview">
+      <%= render partial: "articles/article", object: article %>
+    </div>
+  </div>
+
   <div class="actions">
 <% end %>
```

To ensure a consistent structure between the `articles#show` and the
`articles/content` partial rendered within the `articles#new` template,
we'll change the `articles/article` partial to also render the
`articles/content` partial.

```diff
--- a/app/views/articles/_article.html.erb
+++ b/app/views/articles/_article.html.erb
 <div id="<%= dom_id article %>" class="scaffold_record">
   <p>
     <strong>Content:</strong>
-    <%= article.content %>
+    <%= render partial: "articles/content", object: article.content %>
   </p>
```

The `app/views/articles/_content.html.erb` partial will serve as an
example of server-side rendering. In our case, we'll transform the
`content` into HTML by passing its plain-text value to Action View's
[simple_format][] helper:

```html+erb
<%= simple_format content %>
```

The `#simple_format` view helper wraps any text separate by two newlines
(`\n\n`) in `<p>` elements.

We're being intentional minimal here. If you're feeling imaginative,
consider an `articles/content` partial with more a complicated set of
transformations (like Markdown parsing or other rich-text styling).
